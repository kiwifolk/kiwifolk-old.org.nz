	<p>
	Beltona is a partnership between Steve Evans and Bill Johnson that began in the UK
	in 1990. A luthier and engineer respectively and sharing an interest in resonator
	instruments, we set out to produce a couple of instruments for ourselves.  Bill
	was intrigued by the idea of making musical instruments out of metal and Steve
	had developed an expertise in resonator instrument repair and restoration so had
	access to many original instruments.  We wanted to replicate the original
	features we liked and decided to make adjustments and improvements as well. In
	addition, we were committed to producing all components of each instrument
	ourselves.  As a result of this, a business grew which has been producing the
	finest quality, handcrafted instruments ever since. Beltona is a small and highly
	specialised enterprise which relies on the individual and complementary skills of
	these two people who are committed to the uniqueness of each instrument and to
	the development of resonator instruments generally.

	Celtic Connexions started in Te Aroha in 2004 and has been born out of the need by
	the owner to obtain local Celtic goods here in New Zealand.
	</p>
    
	<p>
	Being a specialist shop, I suppose it was inevitable that a city location was on
	the cards and so the move was made April 06 and now here we are in Claudlands on
	the edge of Hamilton city.
	</p>
    
	<p>
	I&#39;m passionate about all types of music - a player not just of Highland bagpipes
	but smallpipes ,whistles and now that I&#39;m learning  the Irish Uillean Pipes,
	has brought a dream come true of 20 years to own and operate a shop.
	</p>
    
	<p>
	Visits hame to the old land, and also the sourcing of new products is fun. 
	</p>
    
	<p>
	And its not just the  Scottish stuff thats fun sourcing.  Welsh, Irish, Manx,
	Cornish, Breton and Galician  items are on the list too.

	<p>
	A piper for 50 years, I play the highland bagpipe and highland small-pipes. 
	Bagpipes have been my music passion since I was 15. Mainly in pipe bands, 
	but I also have played in many solo piping situations (NZ and overseas) for 
	dancing as well as in Celtic music sessions. For the past 25 years my 
	piping experience has involved being a pipe-major where looking after the
	setup of bagpipes and reeds for other pipers has been a necessary task. 
	Hence my specialising with this instrument in my business. I supply all the 
	necessities for learners including tuition.
